I'll evaluate these titles based on clarity, engagement potential, and practical value for what appears to be Christian educational content. Here's my ranking from best to worst:

**Best (Most Effective)**
1. I'm on death row, can I be saved? - Compelling, addresses urgent spiritual need
2. I just got baptized, now what? - Practical, addresses common next-step question
3. How to find the right Bible for you - Highly practical, serves broad audience
4. How to Study the Bible - Fundamental skill, evergreen content
5. Tithing: 10%, Really? - Addresses common question with intrigue
6. Joining a Church - Practical guidance for spiritual growth

**Good (Solid Appeal)**
7. The Miracles of Moses - Clear topic, strong biblical interest
8. Lazarus of Bethany - Specific, recognizable biblical story
9. The Two Witnesses - Intriguing for prophecy-interested audience
10. Christian Living - Broad appeal but somewhat generic
11. Armor of God Series - Popular topic, though "series" is vague

**Moderate (Needs Refinement)**
12. The Sea of Reeds or the Red Sea - Interesting but academic-sounding
13. Burning Bush - Clear reference but very brief title
14. Symbology of Revelations - Should be "Symbolism," academic tone

**Weakest (Too Vague/Incomplete)**
15. Burning Chariots - Unclear reference, ambiguous
16. helmet/breastplate/footware/sword - Fragment titles, incomplete
17. The Apostles Series - Too generic, "series" adds no value
18. Commentaries for each book - Descriptive but not engaging

The top titles work because they either address specific felt needs or pose intriguing questions that draw readers in.
