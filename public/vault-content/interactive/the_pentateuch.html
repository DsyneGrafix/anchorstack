    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, single-page application is designed to make the complex information on the Pentateuch accessible and engaging. The structure avoids a linear text dump by using a sticky top navigation to jump between five core themes: Introduction, Composition, Priesthood, Sacrificial System, and Theological Significance. This modular approach allows users to explore topics of interest non-linearly. Key interactions include tabbed interfaces for comparing the JEDP sources and the priestly roles, and an interactive donut chart for exploring the sacrificial system. This design prioritizes user-driven discovery and comprehension over passive reading, transforming dense academic data into a dynamic educational tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: The four JEDP sources. Goal: Compare/Organize. Viz/Presentation: Interactive Tabs. Interaction: Click tab to reveal source characteristics. Justification: Allows direct comparison of the distinct theological and stylistic traits of each source, which is more effective than a static table. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Roles of High Priest, Priests, Levites. Goal: Compare. Viz/Presentation: Interactive Tabs. Interaction: Click tab to display duties. Justification: Clearly delineates the hierarchical roles and responsibilities in a digestible format. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Types of sacrifices. Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz/Presentation: Interactive Donut Chart with adjacent details panel. Interaction: Click on a chart segment to update the details panel with that sacrifice's purpose. Justification: Creates an engaging, visual entry point to the data, directly linking the abstract concept (e.g., 'Sin Offering') to its concrete meaning. Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).

                The Pentateuch, or Torah, comprises the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. It forms the foundation of Jewish and Christian faith, weaving together narratives of creation, law, and covenant. This interactive guide explores its complex composition, the pivotal role of the Levitical priesthood, and its enduring theological significance.

                While traditionally attributed to Moses, modern scholarship suggests the Pentateuch is a composite work woven from multiple sources over centuries. The Documentary Hypothesis is the most influential model, proposing four main literary strands: J, E, D, and P. Click the tabs to explore the distinct characteristics of each source.

                The Pentateuch's influence extends far beyond its historical context, providing a theological foundation for both Judaism and Christianity. Its concepts of law, priesthood, and covenant are interpreted and applied in distinct ways within each tradition.
            </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The Torah is the bedrock of **Halakha** (Jewish Law), a living body of law guiding daily life. Its interpretation varies across movements, from Orthodox adherence to immutable divine law to Reform's emphasis on ethical monotheism. Central to Jewish life is **Torah study**, considered a paramount commandment that replaced sacrifice as the primary act of worship after the Temple's destruction.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The Levitical priesthood and its sacrifices are seen as a temporary system **fulfilled and superseded by Jesus Christ**. As the "Great High Priest" in the order of Melchizedek, his once-for-all sacrifice provides ultimate atonement. This establishes the **"priesthood of all believers,"** granting every Christian direct access to God without the need for a human intermediary.

Its core demand is absolute loyalty to Yahweh and the <strong>centralization of worship</strong> in a single, chosen place (Jerusalem).
