    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, dashboard-style SPA is chosen over a linear document structure to enhance user engagement and facilitate non-linear exploration. The core design uses a sticky top navigation to jump between four main thematic sections: 'Overview', 'Roles & Hierarchy', 'Historical Journey', and 'Theological Significance'. This structure breaks down the dense report into digestible, user-selectable topics. The 'Roles' section uses an interactive tab system for direct comparison. The 'History' section employs a clickable timeline to make chronological data explorable. The 'Theology' section uses an interactive donut chart to visualize and explain the types of sacrifices. This design prioritizes user interaction and comprehension by transforming static tables and text into dynamic, explorable components, making the complex information more accessible and engaging. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Hierarchical roles (High Priest, Priests, Levites). Goal: Compare. Viz/Presentation: Interactive Tabs. Interaction: Click to switch content. Justification: Allows for easy, side-by-side comparison of duties without overwhelming the user, superior to a static table. Library/Method: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Historical evolution across four eras. Goal: Show Change. Viz/Presentation: Clickable Horizontal Timeline. Interaction: Click era to display details. Justification: Visually represents the flow of time and makes historical periods distinct and discoverable. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Types of sacrifices. Goal: Organize/Compare. Viz/Presentation: Interactive Donut Chart with a details panel. Interaction: Click chart segment to update details. Justification: Engages the user visually and connects the data point (sacrifice type) directly to its detailed explanation. Library/Method: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: General textual content (origins, requirements, theology). Goal: Inform. Viz/Presentation: Styled content cards. Interaction: Static display. Justification: Organizes text into clean, readable blocks with clear hierarchy. Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS.

                The Levitical Priesthood was a foundational class of priests and ministers in ancient Israel, established by divine command. This interactive experience explores their origins, complex duties, historical evolution, and profound theological legacy.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The priesthood descends from **Levi**, one of Jacob's twelve sons. Within this tribe, the direct priestly line was established through **Aaron**, Moses's elder brother, who became the first high priest. Initially, the firstborn of every family was consecrated to God, but the Levites were chosen to replace them. This centralized religious duties within a single, dedicated tribe, a significant theological shift for the growing nation.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The Levites' zealous loyalty during the **Golden Calf incident** solidified their special status. This transformed Jacob's prophecy that Levi's descendants would be "scattered in Israel." What could have been a curse became a blessing: the Levites received no tribal territory but were dispersed among 48 cities. This unique arrangement allowed them to teach the Law and serve all of Israel, with God Himself as their ultimate inheritance.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        In Christian theology, the Levitical Priesthood is seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. The repetitive animal sacrifices pointed toward a perfect, final sacrifice. The High Priest's entry into the Most Holy Place prefigured Christ's role as the ultimate mediator. The New Testament presents Christ as a superior High Priest in the order of Melchizedek, whose permanent priesthood and once-for-all sacrifice fulfilled and superseded the Levitical system.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        A radical New Testament concept is the "priesthood of all believers." Because of Christ's completed work, all Christians are considered to have direct access to God, removing the need for a human intermediary. This doesn't mean offering atoning sacrifices, but rather "spiritual sacrifices" like praise and holy living. This democratized access to God, fulfilling the original promise for Israel to be a "kingdom of priests" in a new, comprehensive way.

The <strong>Hasmonean</strong> dynasty usurped the office, and later, Roman rulers appointed high priests like <strong>Annas and Caiaphas</strong>, compromising its traditional lineage before the Temple's final destruction in 70 CE.</p>
