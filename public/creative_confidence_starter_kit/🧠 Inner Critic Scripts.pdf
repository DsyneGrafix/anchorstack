        <p class="subtitle">15 powerful responses to silence your creative doubts</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background: #f7fafc; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <h2 style="color: #2d3748; margin-bottom: 1rem;">How to Use These Scripts</h2>
        <p>Your inner critic has been practicing its lines for years. It knows exactly what to say to stop you from creating. But now you have scripts too—powerful, researched responses that will help you reclaim your creative power.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Method:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Recognize:</strong> Notice when your inner critic is speaking</li>
            <li><strong>Pause:</strong> Don't argue or fight—just pause</li>
            <li><strong>Respond:</strong> Use the appropriate script from this guide</li>
            <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Keep creating anyway</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You don't have to believe these responses immediately. Just use them. Confidence comes from action, not perfect thoughts.</p>
