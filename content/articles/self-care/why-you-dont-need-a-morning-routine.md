# 😴 Why You Don't Need a Morning Routine

There’s a myth in the productivity world: that the right routine will save your life.

But real life is messy. Holy. Rhythmic.

## ☕ You’re Not a Machine

God didn’t make robots. He made humans with soul, body, and breath.

You don’t need to perform the perfect morning checklist — you need **presence**.

## ⏰ Grace Over Grind

The best morning routine?
The one that begins with surrender, not performance.

> “His mercies are new every morning.” — Lamentations 3:23
